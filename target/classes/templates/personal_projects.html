            This is my small web project afterall :) This site is built
            on the Spring framework as far as the backend goes. Check out the working
            database demo that's here as well! (The database example tab in the navigation bar.)

        <div class="desc">I worked with a group that was tasked to design and build an application
            for a tutoring service. The main function of the application was to let members
            schedule tutoring sessions with tutors. There is also other business logic such as
            members having administration levels. A administrator can create other members and
            assign roles but a regular member cannot for example.<br>

        <div class="desc">A simple plugin I developed for the open source Runescape client RuneLite.
        The plugin is a simple combat event log. The purpose of this project was to interact with an
        open source project and learn how to explore documentation for an existing project.<br>

            interface implemented is used by both games. Any turn based game can use
            the same interface.
